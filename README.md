# 🧠 Synaptix

Synaptix is a full-stack project I worked on to understand how machine learning and web applications can come together in a practical way. The main idea behind this project is to build an interactive system where users can work with data through a simple interface while the backend handles processing and logic.

## 💡 About the Project
While working on Synaptix, my goal was not just to run code but to understand the overall flow of a real application — from frontend interaction to backend processing. I explored how different parts of a project connect, how APIs communicate, and how deployment works in a real environment.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with project structure, debugging, and making improvements step by step.
